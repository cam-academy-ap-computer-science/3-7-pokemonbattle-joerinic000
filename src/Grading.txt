Great work!

Just a couple minor issues.  After calculating the damage, you use a "print" instead of a "println" to print out the new HP
value, which means that the start of your stats table ends up stuck at the end of that printed line.  Also, you aren't passing
the new HP value back out of your damage() method, but the entered HP value.  You need to be passing the newly-updated HP
value out of that routine so that it is what will print on the stats table.

I loved that you created a separate method to do the complex calculation.  That's a great extra step!  It makes the code much
easier to read, and makes that calculation easier to test.  Well done.
